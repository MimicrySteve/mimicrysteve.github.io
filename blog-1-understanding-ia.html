            >The size of an object is not just 10 pixels at time 0 and 100 pixels at time 100. Instead the size is a
            function! size = 10 x (time). So that as time goes on - forever - the tree constantly grows (possibly off
            the screen). The artist must think about this new dimension as well.<br /><br />Luckily there are some
            obvious and common situations - here MIMICRY’s GUI is already fully capable. Through the toolbar interface
            users can easily apply and adjust common function to objects.<br /><br />Using the tree example, MIMICRY has
            already built in an infinite growth function where the bounds can be set. The artist can easily setup where
            a tree should ALWAYS be growing but it should never be small that the lower limit at the start and never
            bigger than the upper limit even at infinite time.

          The most obvious feature of Infinite Animation Artwork (IA) is that it is Perpetual. This means that each
          individual piece uses a collection of AI techniques and then is rendered realtime for the viewer so that the
          depicted scene forever updates. This crucial feature distinguishes perpetual art from all other previous art
          forms. <br /><br />1. The artwork is alive<br />Its constantly changing nature is always producing something
          new for the viewer. That update has never been seen before as it is generated according to the artist
          determined algorithms. This is the main allure of IA - each time you go to view a piece, it is brand new
          information for the viewer - significantly increasing the amount of time spent viewing a single piece and
          additionally increasing the future likelihood of return viewers to the same piece. This perpetual nature makes
          persistent art closer to performance art or a live stream. Despite similarities in their content streamers
          draw large audiences due to the uniqueness of every stream. Furthermore, there is an element of not wanting to
          miss a stream for fear of missing some interesting update. Persistent art has these elements as well - viewers
          are drawn back in if they want to know the full story.<br /><br />2. The updates can include new information
          or data not yet known to the artist<br />The artist - through code - can pull updated information at each
          frame incorporating that new information into the visual aspects of the art. With any piece that is rendered
          prior to viewing, the piece must pick a static set of historical data and the art can at best show that old
          information. As persistent art is constantly updating it can incorporate this data into the visual elements
          realtime. Completely changing how a viewer interacts with a piece of artwork and the way in which new
          information can be conveyed to a viewer.<br /><br />This can be used in various ways: to tell a story, to
          showcase a game, to express the complexities of a given scene. The platform allows for all types of art -
          deceptively simple or exceedingly complex. Regardless, the switch from artist generating a static image to
          artist generating a static algorithm [that utilizes possibly changing data] which produces an ever changing
          image provides a limitless platform.<br /><br />Artist have to think differently about art:<br />When making a
          static piece of artwork, the artist must conceive of the immediate visual elements of each depicted object.
          What color is the best, how large should the head be relative to the body, is the lighting correct? When
          making an animation, the artist must ask themselves and have vision about the limited future of each object.
          How will this object change over time? WIll the color be static or determined based on some outside data? Does
          this object grow over time? Is this object always visible to the viewer or is it off screen at some points?<br /><br />Infinite
          animation takes this one step further. By requiring the artist to ensure that the future of objects is
          infinite. How should an obj change when it’s lifetime is infinite.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Carving
          out a future for Artists<br />Faced with the emergence of DALLE-2 and similar art generating AI, we must ask
          ourselves what will art look like in the future. What place do humans have when AI encrouches on the realm of
          artist and can produce quality art in a fraction of the time?<br /><br />Infinite Animation Artwork is the
          answer. Flexible machine learning required to write arbitrary code is a decade off - if it’s even possible.
          Therefore, while DALLE-2 can recreate masterpiece paintings today, Infinite Animation Artwork will always
          require a human. Specifically IA requires a human in order to write unique code for each an every element in
          the piece. IA is future proof because it works on the idea of: the artist codes the parts of the artwork that
          a machine can’t do and leaves the rest of the computation to the machine learning algorthims. Therefore AI can
          never replace human artists by design.<br /><br /><br />Importance for NFTs<br />The perpetual aspect of IA is
          one key piece to the puzzle for creating varifiably valuable NFTs. Creating soft assets is not an easy task
          and to guarentee they have value, some pretty extreme conditions must be met. Being perpetual is necessary but
          not sufficient on it’s own. In the rest of this blog series, we talk about the other conditions that make IA
          NFT’s so unique and valuable
