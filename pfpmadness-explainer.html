              This piece is one artist’s attempt at mocking the current state of the NFT ecosystem today. The scene
              depicts the ongoings of an elementary school playground. Instead of enjoying their time outside, the kids
              are huddled up on the pavement battling with their PFPs.<br />The scene pokes fun at the current industry
              by highlighting that the current discourse around NFTs is no different than children arguing about Pokemon
              cards. Glory (on the playground at least) comes to whomever has the rarest card- ignoring more important
              criteria not appreciated by this specific school class or at this young age.<br />The scene also takes
              inspiration from the parody rap battles of the 2010’s. They too poked fun at a trend which had a widely
              popular following. Similar to rap battles the winner is determined not by being the “best” but instead by
              some unknown criteria determined by the listeners. In PFP Madness, the winner of each round is not
              necessarily the rarest.

                PFP Madness plays a single competition a day. At the end of the week a winner is selected from the
                competition set. This winner is turned into a separate PFP NFT published to the blockchain - immediately
                generated to the wallet of whoever owns this piece.<br />After a new NFT is generated, the probability
                distribution of each possible feature is adjusted - reducing it’s likelihood. This makes owning one of
                these PFPs a bet on the rarity of its individual features in the future final generated set.
